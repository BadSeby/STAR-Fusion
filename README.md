# STAR-Fusion

Click the 'wiki' link at top for the STAR-Fusion documentation. 

To download the software, click the 'Releases' tab and download the 'FULL'-labeled version.


Note, if you're going to clone the code from github (not recommended for production use!), do it recursively like so:

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion.git


Development happens off the master branch, and we make extensive use of git submodules.
