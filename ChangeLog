Version 1.0.0 (Feb 1, 2017)
	including dinucleotide splice sites in the report
	incorporate FFPM values whenever fastq reads are given, regardless of using the chimeric junction files direction.
	uses samtools to extract sequence regions from the genome, rather than putting the entire genome into memory.
	

Version 0.8.0 (July 28, 2016):
	FFPM stats computed correctly when using gzipped fastq files
	upgraded FusionFilter: better takes into account overlapping genes and no longer (inadvertently) filters them out as candidate paralogs.
	
Version 0.7.0 (Mar 5, 2016)
	Update to FusionFilter v0.1.0
	Require long double anchor support for those fusions only supported by breakpoint/split reads and no spanning fragments, reduces FP rate.

Version 0.6.0 (Dec 16, 2015)
	including FFPM calculations in output summary.

Version 0.5.4 (Nov, 10, 2015)
	update to FusionFilter, no 2-pass in genome-generate function

Version 0.5.3 (Nov, 6, 2015)
	removed duplicate PE alignments supporting fusions, decreases FP rate dramatically on samples w/ high PCR dups, w/ little effect on other 'good' samples w/ low DUP rate.

Version 0.5.2 (Oct 26, 2016)
	Bugfix for paired cigar-string alignment parsing leading to proper grouping of junction counts.

Version 0.5.1 (Oct 10, 2015)
     added back capability to run STAR-Fusion from an existing Chimeric.out.junctions file from an earlier STAR run.
     Use parameter:  --chimeric_junction|J or (--left_fq, --right_fq)
